# movies-correlation-project
Movies Correlation Project is a Python project that analyzes the correlation between various factors affecting the success of movies. This project uses data from multiple sources to build a correlation matrix that identifies the relationships between variables such as genre, runtime, rating, budget, and box office performance.

The project includes several modules that perform data collection, cleaning, and preprocessing, as well as statistical analysis and visualization. The modules are designed to be highly modular and customizable, so users can easily modify the code to suit their specific needs.
